***Questions

°°°What is the role of bigobj.lds in povacca ?°°°

This is a linker script, that defines how the linker organizes a specific section of memory, in this case the .data section.

°°°Why did I choose to place the stack before data ?°°°

In my opinion, we choose to place the stack before data because, the stack grows toward lower adresses and data toward higher adresses. So, placing stack before the data ensures the stack overflows into the data section (maybe we can take the exemple of FIFO (First In First Out) to explain this ?).

°°°Explain commit 6f02764°°°

Below, you can see what is the commit 6f02764.
Briefly, we just add the function time_before(), used to compare 2 values (here jiffies and j). It can return true (or false) if jiffies is before j.
This helps prevent errors due to overflow when jiffies reaches its maximum value.

--- a/sw/tests-lpc/hello-main.c
+++ b/sw/tests-lpc/hello-main.c

-               while (jiffies < j)
+               while (time_before(jiffies, j))

+++ b/sw/tests-lpc/leds-main.c

-               while (jiffies < j)
+               while (time_before(j, jiffies))

-               while (jiffies < j)
+               while (time_before(j, jiffies))
